Additionally, it provides an overview of current issues relevant to the development of entrepreneurial policy, which is based on interesting case studies across a number of nations. . . Dessy Irawati, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research What is new in the world is the need to understand business dynamics; the entry, exit and growth of firms in the economy. This dynamic firm structure, as opposed to the static firm structure that dominated past thinking, has spurred an outpouring of research. The heart of the issue is that while many have identified the importance of business dynamics (entry and exit) we have only recently taken a closer look at the ecological system in which some companies must die for others to thrive. Entrepreneurs are the predators of this system. Public policy in an entrepreneurial economy (dynamic) must limit the forces that prevent firm exit and foster the forces that promote firm entry. This book makes an important contribution to the debate. Zoltan J. Acs, George Mason University, US and Max Planck Institute of Economics, Germany This unique Handbook provides a solid foundation for essential study in the nascent field of entrepreneurship policy research. This foundation is initially developed via the exploration of two significant propositions underpinning the nature of entrepreneurship policy research. The first is that entrepreneurship has emerged as a bona fide focus of public policy, particularly with respect to economic growth and employment creation. The second is that neither scholars nor policy makers are presently equipped to understand the public policy role for entrepreneurship. The contributors experienced scholars, specialist researchers and dynamic policy makers thus grapple with novel questions of considerable policy relevance that few have previously posed. The Handbook therefore provides some of the first crucial, systematic analyses of important issues, and key questions to be raised in order to move entrepreneurship policy forward are also presented. Written by academics and practitioners drawing examples from both North America and Europe, this stimulating new Handbook is a prerequisite for students, scholars and practitioners in the incipient world of entrepreneurship policy.',NULL,'2025-12-29 11:51:07','2025-12-29 11:51:07'),

Begin by reviewing foundational stepping stones (with small, manageable examples to show proof of concepts as well as illustrations to conceptualize the more complex topics) of both DDD and Laravel. Specifically, such topics as entities, value objects, developing an ubiquitous language, DTOs, and knowledge discovery. Next, you will dive into some more advanced topics of DDD and use these concepts as a guide to make customizations to the default Laravel installation, giving you an understanding of why these alterations are vital to the DDD and Laravel platform. Finally, you will cover the very powerful Eloquent ORM that comes stock with Laravel and understand how it can be utilized to represent entities, handle repositories, and support domain events. Although there is a basic coverage chapter and a setup tutorial for Laravel (along with a high level intro about the components used within it), Domain-Driven Laravel is best suited to readers who have been at least exposed to the framework and have had the opportunity to tinker around with it. What You\'ll Learn Utilize a blazing-fast rapid development pipeline built from DDD building blocks and facilitated with Laravel Implement value objects, repositories, entities, anti-corruption layers and others using Laravel as a web framework Apply enhanced techniques for quick prototyping of complex requirements and quality results using an iterative and focused approach Create a base framework (Laravel) that can serve as a template to start off any project Gain insight on which details are important to a project’s success and how to acquire the necessary knowledge Who This Book Is For Ideal for for frontend/backend web developers, devops engineers, Laravel framework lovers and PHP developers hoping to learn more about either Domain Driven Design or the possibilities with the Laravel framework. Those with a working knowledge of plain PHP can also gain value from reading this book.',42,1,'2020-11-14','2025-12-29 11:50:55','2025-12-29 11:50:55'),

Additionally, it provides an overview of current issues relevant to the development of entrepreneurial policy, which is based on interesting case studies across a number of nations. . . Dessy Irawati, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research What is new in the world is the need to understand business dynamics; the entry, exit and growth of firms in the economy. This dynamic firm structure, as opposed to the static firm structure that dominated past thinking, has spurred an outpouring of research. The heart of the issue is that while many have identified the importance of business dynamics (entry and exit) we have only recently taken a closer look at the ecological system in which some companies must die for others to thrive. Entrepreneurs are the predators of this system. Public policy in an entrepreneurial economy (dynamic) must limit the forces that prevent firm exit and foster the forces that promote firm entry. This book makes an important contribution to the debate. Zoltan J. Acs, George Mason University, US and Max Planck Institute of Economics, Germany This unique Handbook provides a solid foundation for essential study in the nascent field of entrepreneurship policy research. This foundation is initially developed via the exploration of two significant propositions underpinning the nature of entrepreneurship policy research. The first is that entrepreneurship has emerged as a bona fide focus of public policy, particularly with respect to economic growth and employment creation. The second is that neither scholars nor policy makers are presently equipped to understand the public policy role for entrepreneurship. The contributors experienced scholars, specialist researchers and dynamic policy makers thus grapple with novel questions of considerable policy relevance that few have previously posed. The Handbook therefore provides some of the first crucial, systematic analyses of important issues, and key questions to be raised in order to move entrepreneurship policy forward are also presented. Written by academics and practitioners drawing examples from both North America and Europe, this stimulating new Handbook is a prerequisite for students, scholars and practitioners in the incipient world of entrepreneurship policy.',28,1,'2025-12-29','2025-12-29 11:51:07','2025-12-29 11:51:07'),
